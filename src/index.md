Charmed LMA is a collection of Kubernetes Operators that help manage the
complexity of operating a logging, monitoring, and alerting infrastructure.
The project is still in its early stages of development but below you can

Charmed LMA.

We're looking for folks who can help kick the tires and tell us what works
and what doesn't. If you're interested, head on over to our [GitHub org]({{ site.github.owner_url }})
and try out one or more of the charms!
